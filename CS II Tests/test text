"The world's smallest 'swarm robot' measures 25 nanometers in diameter and 5 micrometers in length, and exhibits swarming
behavior resembling motile organisms such as fish, ants and birds.'Swarm robots are one of the most elusive subjects in
robotics,' says Akira Kakugo of the research team at Hokkaido University. 'Fish schools, ant colonies and bird flocks show
fascinating features that cannot be achieved by individuals acting alone. These include the formation of complex structures,
distinct divisions of labor, robustness and flexibility, all of which emerge through local interactions among the individuals
without the presence of a leader.' Inspired by these characteristics, researchers have been working to develop micro-scale
swarm robots." - from "Letting molecular robots swarm like birds", Science Daily
