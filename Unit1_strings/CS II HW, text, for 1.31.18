The differences between string, list, and tuple.

While a string and a list are both mutatable variables, a tuple is actually unchangeable.

A tuple stores two pieces of data within one variable, a string one, and a list infinite.

Between a list and a string, a list is much more useful of a data type, because it allows the user
to store endless pieces of data while also allowing flexibility in data types stored, as well as
endless mutability. In the case of a string, there is only one data type allowed (string).

I hate tuples because I can't change them and that gives me errors sometimes.
