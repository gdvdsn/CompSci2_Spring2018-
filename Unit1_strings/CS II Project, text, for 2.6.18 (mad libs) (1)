Zeus, the ___ (n) of the Gods was married to a nice ___ (n) named Metis.
But one day, his ___ (family member) told him that when Metis had a ___ (n),
it would overthrow him. He was very ___ (emotion). Soon, when Metis was
transoforming into various ___ (n), she ___ (v) into a dragonfly, and Zeus
ate her. Metis ___ (v) inside of Zeus' head for a very long time. Eventually,
she had her baby, and the ___ (n) began to grow older. Metis taught her
daugher about ___ (v) and ___ (v). One day, the inside of Zeus' head became
too ___ (size) for both of them to live in, and Zeus got a headache.
He ___ (v) his ___ (family member) and asked them to split his ___ (n)
open to get out whatever was hurting him. They split open his ___ (n) and out
came Metis' ___ (family member): the goddess Athena.
